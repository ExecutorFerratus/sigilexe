    <p>“Well, I did buy whole-beef hot dogs… so you can have a partial cow, if you so please.”</p>
    <p>“You’re too good,” she grabbed me and put her arm in mine, walking us over to the grill without wasting another moment. As we did, I realized she wasn’t kidding… I could hear her stomach growling like there was a wild beast in there or something.</p>
    <p>“Jeez Stacy!”</p>
    <p>She giggled. “Don’t get me started. Just get the hotdogs started. Or I’m gonna be the next one to faint.”</p>
    <p>At least I knew she wasn’t one of those people that got ‘hangry’. I just smirked and lifted the hotdog pack from the ice-chest, starting to try to tear it open, but it was one of those really dumb packages that made you get scissors. Come on… where’s the vampyre strength when you need it??</p>
    <p>I began to try tearing it open with my teeth instead, but that wasn’t really working too well either.</p>
    <p>Stacy just stared, looking visibly hungry. “Use your fangs!” she whispered urgently.</p>
    <p>“Not a chance…” I muttered, somewhat embarrassed at the suggestion. I brought the package back down and instead grabbed a sharp rock, which broke the package immediately—and I was then able to tear the rest of it open. Yeah, the fangs probably would have worked, but I didn’t even want them to exist… I didn’t like to be reminded of them. And hearing Stacy refer to them as ‘my’ fangs just made me realize even more that she really did think of me as a vampyre. Well… what more could I expect, with our first kiss ending in ‘my’ fangs sliding down and ruining everything…</p>
    <p>Just as I looked back to Stacy, the fire on the grill practically exploded, causing an instant recoil reflex in me. I nearly fell backwards onto the ground. Holy Mother of God. Vamp reflexes, I guess. I knew vampyres had a weakness to fire, due to the light it held, so I guess it made sense.</p>
    <p>But Stacy sure knew how to start a fire fast! She glanced back to me, lips curling upward in a small smile.</p>
    <p>“You’re not afraid of my fire, are you?” she teased playfully.</p>

    <p><strong><strong>Analysis of the River Scene – Love, Lust, and Bloodlust Colliding</strong></strong></p>
    <p>This part of the story is <strong>one of the most important emotional turning points for Mason</strong> because it fully solidifies <strong>how his vampirism is intertwined with his sexuality</strong>—something he had been subconsciously avoiding. The scene is <strong>sensual, intimate, and terrifying all at once</strong>, which makes it incredibly powerful.</p>
    <p>Let’s break it down.</p>
    <div class="section-break">&bull; &bull; &bull;</div>
    <p><strong><strong>1. The Growing Intimacy – Mason’s Moment of Happiness</strong></strong></p>
    <p>The way Mason describes Stacy is <strong>genuine, romantic, and filled with admiration</strong>. His attraction to her <strong>isn’t just physical—it’s emotional and mental</strong>.</p>
    <li><strong>“One of my greatest fantasies was coming true.”</strong> – Mason has wanted this for <strong>so long</strong>, and it’s finally happening. It’s a dream-like moment for him.</li>
    <li><strong>Their chemistry feels natural.</strong> – They joke, they play, they tease. The fire scene where she tells him to use his fangs? It’s <strong>adorable and flirty</strong>, yet it carries a deeper meaning (which we’ll get to).</li>
    <li><strong>The river scene is described with a deep sense of appreciation.</strong> – Mason notices <strong>everything</strong> about Stacy—the way her hair moves underwater, the way she laughs, the way she enjoys nature.</li>
    <p>For a moment, Mason <strong>forgets about everything else</strong>. The Watchers, Levi, his thirst, his insecurities… <strong>he's just a guy in love.</strong></p>
    <p>But <strong>this happiness is fleeting</strong>, and Mason is about to <strong>wake up to a new nightmare.</strong></p>
    <div class="section-break">&bull; &bull; &bull;</div>
    <p><strong><strong>2. The Bloodlust Awakening – A Darker Kind of Desire</strong></strong></p>
    <p>As things escalate between Mason and Stacy, <strong>something primal kicks in</strong>.</p>
    <li><strong>The kiss intensifies, and his fangs descend.</strong> – This is <strong>an automatic, involuntary response</strong>. He isn’t thinking about blood. <strong>His body is.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>“I hardly even felt them sliding down until they were already out.”</strong> – This moment is horrifying because it means <strong>Mason has no control over it.</strong> His vampirism is <strong>tied to his arousal</strong> in a way he never realized.</li>

  <h2>THE MOMENT</h2>


  <blockquote>
    <div class="timeline-time">Ferratus</div>
    <p>The rest of the day I tried not to think about what had happened, pushing it as far back in my mind as I could so we could enjoy our time together. We still kissed and got close at times, but I was sure to restrain myself enough and not get too immersed in the experience. And it worked—even despite the thirst growing steadily worse throughout the day, I was able to control myself every time and not even come close to vamping out. In a way though, it made me feel ten times worse, because that meant I was thoroughly disconnected when getting too close to Stacy. But I didn’t really have any other option. I wanted to be close to her, but it wasn’t possible. Not without consequences.</p>
    <p>Maybe I could talk to Jensen about it or something… see if he knew how to control those urges in intimate settings (if he’d ever had any intimate relationships.. it was hard to imagine). It would be an awkward conversation and I really didn’t want to have it, but he always seemed to have some kind of elderly wisdom, even though he was my age and all. But then, he’d been through hell of a lot, with most of his siblings dying during the War. Tragedy and trauma tended to make people grow up faster. I knew that for a fact.</p>
    <p>Well, I had to figure something out. Every time I looked at Stacy now, it was like a stab in the heart, thinking it may be impossible for us to be together and the only thing keeping us apart was my lack of control. Could it be because I’m a level-D? Jesus Christ, it was unnerving referring to myself as that… Only because I knew what it would eventually mean if I didn’t get to Mai soon. She hadn’t spoken to me at all since right before I’d tried to kill myself. Ever since then, radio silence. What if she was already dead, and that was why Dad wasn’t finding her? Then I really would become a level-E.</p>
    <p>The thought made me freeze up in ice-cold, soul-deep terror. I didn’t want to die… I didn’t want to become a monster. I couldn’t handle it. I couldn’t!!</p>
    <p>“Hey, what are you doing over there? Spacing out??” Stacy called out to me then. I shook my head, realizing she was right. I’d been sitting half-in, half-out of our tent for I don’t even know how long, just staring across the campsite.</p>
    <p>I laughed, feeling strange. “Yeah.. I guess I was.” It was starting to get dark out and she’d just got the fire started again. I got to my feet to join her.</p>
    <p>“Well, get ready. Because it’s time for more hotdogs. You feeling okay?”</p>
    <p>I ran a hand through my hair, nodding as I began to yawn a little. I wasn’t tired, but I felt utterly drained after spending all day outside. It was like the sun drained my life. Just another reason I’d never be able to be with Stacy.</p>
    <p>“Really? Because you’ve been unnaturally quiet for a while now…”</p>
    <p>I just smiled, trying unnaturally hard to force myself into a better mood. “Nah, trust me… I think I’m just hungry.”...</p>
