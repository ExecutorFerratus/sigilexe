  <h2>THE SETUP</h2>


  <div class="timeline-item">
    <div class="timeline-time">Velius</div>
    <p><strong><strong>CASSIUS—THE MOMENT I HESITATED</strong></strong></p>
    <p>Tullius's words sat heavy in my mind, <strong>lodged like a blade that would not pull free.</strong></p>
    <p>I had been ready for Livia’s disapproval.</p>
    <p>Ready for Augustus’s silent judgment.</p>
    <p>Ready for <strong>Valeria’s sharp, knowing smirk as she chose to stand beside me instead.</strong></p>
    <p>But Tullius?</p>
    <p>Tullius had always been the one who laughed at danger.</p>
    <p>The one who <strong>thrived in chaos, thrived in war, thrived in destruction.</strong></p>
    <p>If even <strong>he</strong> thought I had gone too far—</p>
    <p><strong>Had I?</strong></p>
    <p><em>"Tullius, I did not order their deaths."</em></p>
    <p>My voice was steady.</p>
    <p>But even as I spoke, I felt the <strong>first crack of doubt creep into my mind.</strong></p>
    <p><em>"I don’t have the power to make such orders."</em></p>
    <p><em>"Not directly."</em></p>
    <p>Tullius was watching me carefully.</p>
    <p>Like he was <strong>trying to see past the Cassius standing before him.</strong></p>
    <p>Trying to find <strong>the Cassius he had known before.</strong></p>
    <p><em>"But you didn’t need to order it, did you?"</em></p>
    <p>His words were slow.</p>
    <p>Measured.</p>
    <p>A rare thing for him.</p>
    <p><em>"You didn’t tell them to kill. But you created the world where they would."</em></p>
    <p>I exhaled sharply, shaking my head.</p>
    <p><em>"It was a consequence."</em></p>
    <p><em>"A consequence?"</em></p>
    <p>He scoffed, rubbing a hand over his face, pacing once before stopping, fixing me with a stare that was <strong>not mocking. Not playful. Not cruel.</strong></p>
    <p>Just <strong>disappointed.</strong></p>
    <p><em>"Cassia, a consequence is when you drink too much wine and wake up with a headache."</em></p>
    <p>He stepped closer.</p>
    <p><em>"A consequence is when you gamble away your coin and go hungry for a night."</em></p>
    <p>His voice <strong>lowered.</strong></p>
    <p><em>"A consequence is not the streets running red because of whispers you placed in the right ears."</em></p>
    <p>I <strong>opened my mouth</strong>—to deny it, to argue—</p>
    <p>But <strong>the words did not come.</strong></p>
    <p>Because the moment he had spoken them—</p>
    <p>I knew they were <strong>true.</strong></p>
    <div class="section-break">&bull; &bull; &bull;</div>
    <p><strong><strong>TULLIUS—THE MOMENT I SAW HIM FALTER</strong></strong></p>
    <p>Cassius <strong>never faltered anymore.</strong></p>
    <p>Not in battle.</p>
    <p>Not in politics.</p>
    <p>Not in strategy.</p>
    <p>But now?...</p>
  </div>

  <div class="timeline-item">
    <div class="timeline-time">Ferratus</div>
    <p>​"I was trying to save Rome. If I hadn't done this, it would have been doomed, Tullius. The bankers need to be crushed. Every last one of them..." I said, going back and forth in my own mind. As I spoke, Osiris lazily walked over and climbed onto my lap... Oh no...</p>

  <h2>THE MOMENT</h2>


  <blockquote>
    <div class="timeline-time">Velius</div>
    <p><strong><strong>CASSIUS—THE MOMENT OF UNCERTAINTY (AND BETRAYAL)</strong></strong></p>
    <p><em>"I was trying to save Rome."</em></p>
    <p>The words left my mouth, but even as I said them, <strong>they felt hollow.</strong></p>
    <p>Because now?</p>
    <p>Now, I wasn’t sure if <strong>Rome had been saved... or if I had simply shattered it into something unrecognizable.</strong></p>
    <p>Tullius said nothing.</p>
    <p>He just watched me.</p>
    <p>Waiting.</p>
    <p>Letting me <strong>wrestle with the ghosts I had created.</strong></p>
    <p><em>"If I hadn't done this, it would have been doomed, Tullius. The bankers need to be crushed. Every last one of them..."</em></p>
    <p>I ran my hands over my face, feeling the weight of it all pressing down on me.</p>
    <p>The blood spilled.</p>
    <p>The power shifting.</p>
    <p>The chaos growing beyond my reach.</p>
    <p>And then—</p>
    <p><strong>Osiris.</strong></p>
    <p>Casually, <strong>unbothered by the weight of history or the existential crisis in my mind,</strong> my treacherous little bastard of a cat <strong>sauntered into my lap.</strong></p>
    <p><em>"No, no, not now—"</em></p>
    <p>I tried to push him off, but it was <strong>too late.</strong></p>
    <div class="section-break">&bull; &bull; &bull;</div>
    <p><strong><strong>TULLIUS—THE MOMENT I LOST IT</strong></strong></p>
    <p>At first, I had been serious.</p>
    <p>At first, I had been ready to argue, to press him, to demand he take a <strong>fucking breath and see what he had done.</strong></p>
    <p>But then.</p>
    <p><strong>Then Osiris happened.</strong></p>
    <p>The gods had <strong>a sense of humor.</strong></p>
    <p>Because in the middle of Cassius’s <strong>greatest moment of doubt—</strong></p>
    <p>In the middle of his <strong>internal war—</strong></p>
    <p>The little beast <strong>climbed onto his lap and immediately began… kneading.</strong></p>
    <p>Cassius <strong>froze.</strong></p>
    <p>And then—</p>
    <p><strong>Then the worst possible thing happened.</strong></p>
    <p>Osiris, <strong>in all his glory, flopped onto his side…</strong></p>
    <p><strong>And began aggressively licking himself.</strong></p>
    <p>And that?</p>
    <p>That was the <strong>final blow.</strong></p>
    <p>I <strong>completely lost it.</strong></p>
    <p>I mean, <strong>fully, violently laughing.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Falling back against the couch, wheezing, clutching my ribs.</strong></p>
    <p><em>"OH—OH FUCK, NOT AGAIN—"</em></p>
    <p>Cassius <strong>shoved Osiris off his lap, groaning.</strong></p>
    <p><em>"NO, FUCK THIS, HE WAS JUST WALKING AROUND—"</em></p>
    <p>I was <strong>gone.</strong></p>
    <p>I could barely <strong>breathe.</strong></p>
    <p><em>"NOT THE SPEECH, CASSIA! NOT DURING THE SPEECH—"</em></p>
    <p>Cassius <strong>buried his face in his hands.</strong></p>
    <p><em>"I HATE THIS FUCKING CAT!"</em></p>
    <p>Osiris, <strong>completely unbothered, stretched luxuriously and flicked his tail.</strong></p>
    <p>And I?</p>
    <p>I <strong>laughed until I could not breathe.</strong></p>
    <div class="section-break">&bull; &bull; &bull;</div>
    <p><strong><strong>CASSIUS—THE FINAL HUMILIATION</strong></strong></p>
    <p><em>"You’re a horrible person, Tullius."</em></p>
    <p>I said it flatly, still rubbing my temples as Tullius <strong>wiped tears from his eyes.</strong></p>
    <p><em>"Oh, but Cassia—Cassia, no—</em>"</p>
    <p><em>"SHUT UP—"</em></p>
    <p><em>"The best part—</em>"</p>
    <p><em>"DON'T—"</em></p>
    <p><em>"—is that he KNEW. He KNEW it was the WORST POSSIBLE TIME, and he did it ANYWAY!"</em></p>
    <p>Tullius <strong>was wheezing again, half-falling off the couch.</strong></p>
    <p>And <strong>just when I thought it was over—</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Livia walked in.</strong></p>
    <p>Saw me.</p>
    <p>Saw Tullius dying of laughter.</p>
    <p>Saw Osiris stretching smugly.</p>
    <p>And her expression?</p>
    <p>Flat.</p>
    <p>Unimpressed.</p>
    <p>Completely <strong>done.</strong></p>
    <p><em>"I see it has happened again."</em></p>
    <p>I groaned, throwing myself back against the couch.</p>
    <p><em>"I HATE ALL OF YOU."</em>...</p>
