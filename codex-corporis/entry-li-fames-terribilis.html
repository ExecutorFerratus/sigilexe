  <h2>THE SETUP</h2>


  <div class="timeline-item">
    <div class="timeline-time">Ferratus</div>
    <p>Mason:</p>
    <p>I shook my head, mentally berating myself-- but in the back of my mind I couldn't stop thinking about it. It was starting to occupy too much of my mind.</p>
    <p>I set my pencil down, trying to clear my head, and started to hold my breath so I wouldn't smell it for at least several seconds. But as I was doing that, I felt the sickening sensation of the fangs sliding down again. I bit down hard when I felt it happening, thinking if I applied enough pressure it would stop them from coming out, but it didn't work.</p>
    <p>Feeling them sitting against the inside of my bottom lip, I felt a wave of nausea mixed with intense loathing. Here I was, lusting over the blood of my classmates, unable to even concentrate on anything else... Disgusting. It was pathetic. I was just like the vampyres I hated now, wasn't I?</p>
    <p>I put my head down against my desk, closing my eyes tightly as I tried to control my thoughts. Life had always been somewhat of a nightmare, anyway.. But now it was just a living hell. There was no way I would survive this if it continued this way... I had to figure out what I was going to do....</p>
    <p>After class I would have to come up with a plan. Maybe there was some research.. for those who were turned.. maybe there was a way to reverse it somehow. If it was still recent and all. I couldn't just give up so easily. This was my life-- my one and only life-- and I had been so close to actually starting my own path and doing something with my future...</p>
    <p>I sighed and began sipping at my water again to interrupt the feeling of thirst, which was becoming increasingly hard to deal with. It didn't matter how much water I drank... But I had no choice but to keep drinking it...</p>

    <p><strong><strong>Analysis of Mason’s Mental and Emotional State: The Breaking Point</strong></strong></p>
    <p>This chapter is <strong>Mason’s descent into the abyss</strong>—the moment where his struggle with identity, control, and survival reaches its most terrifying, claustrophobic extreme. Everything he’s been suppressing explodes in a full-on psychological breakdown, blurring the lines between his mind, body, and instincts. This isn’t just Mason battling vampirism. This is Mason battling <strong>himself.</strong></p>
    <div class="section-break">&bull; &bull; &bull;</div>
    <p><strong><strong>1. The Collapse of Self-Control: From Suppression to Implosion</strong></strong></p>
    <p>Mason’s entire strategy since his transformation has been one thing: <strong>control.</strong> Control his thirst. Control his emotions. Control his image. But control isn’t sustainable when it’s rooted in denial. <strong>And that’s where Mason is failing.</strong></p>
    <li><strong>The Flawed Coping Mechanism:</strong></li>
    <blockquote><em>“I set my pencil down, trying to clear my head, and started to hold my breath so I wouldn't smell it…”</em></blockquote>
    <p>Mason’s attempts to “manage” his instincts—holding his breath, chugging water, biting his lip—are <em>band-aids</em> on a gaping wound. He’s not addressing the core problem. He’s just suppressing it, and suppression without acknowledgment only makes the pressure worse.</p>
    <li><strong>The Water Obsession:</strong></li>
    <p>The water fountain becomes both his literal and symbolic lifeline:</p>
    <blockquote><em>“Drinking from that fountain was the only thing I could do…”</em></blockquote>
    <p>It’s the one thing keeping him tethered to a sense of “normalcy.” But it’s an illusion. The more he drinks, the worse it gets because <strong>he’s not thirsty for water.</strong> This obsessive behavior mirrors addiction patterns—trying to replace an uncontrollable craving with something “safer,” only to spiral deeper when it doesn’t satisfy.</p>
    <div class="section-break">&bull; &bull; &bull;</div>
    <p><strong><strong>2. The Internalized Self-Hatred: Mason as His Own Worst Enemy</strong></strong></p>
    <p>Mason’s <strong>hatred of vampyres</strong> has always been intense, but now that hatred is turned inward—and it’s eating him alive.</p>
    <li><strong>The Monologue of Self-Loathing:</strong>...</li>

  <h2>THE MOMENT</h2>


  <blockquote>
    <div class="timeline-time">Ferratus</div>
    <p>After what seemed to be at least an hour of pure horrific dread and no consequences, I finally started thinking that maybe nothing was going to happen after all...</p>
    <p>My heart slowed down a notch and I was able to come out of the covers and start to face the world once again. I slowly sat up, taking a deep and painful breath.</p>
    <p>What had just happened?</p>
    <p>I blinked tightly, just sitting on the bed as the fear began to leave my system. My hands were shaking like an alcoholic's, and I felt incredibly unstable-- but the panic wasn't so bad anymore.. I could think again.</p>
    <p>I wasn't dying... Or changing any more than I already had. I was okay... For now\...</p>
    <p>But, my throat was still parched. I needed.. water...</p>
    <p>Standing up, I left my room and walked to the kitchen, feeling like I'd survived something awful. A complete panic attack... Maybe that's what it had been.. A panic attack...</p>
    <p>I filled my water bottle and began drinking again, trying to soothe my throat.</p>
    <p>Back to square one. So I wasn't dying.. I was just becoming a monster. That's all...</p>
    <p>I drank the water faster, feeling desperate all over again. Who was I even supposed to talk to about reversing vampyrism? I knew nobody... And the vampyres wouldn't want to tell me, even if they did know. The internet was my best option..</p>
    <p>I brought my computer back to the kitchen and sat at the table, beginning some independent research on the topic. I should have done this the moment I found out I was changing..</p>
    <p>"How to reverse vampyrism," I typed into the search engine. Instantly, a thousand different things came up-- some of them completely fictitious, and others obviously more legitimate. But it was hard sorting through them... I clicked on the first one, which gave a bunch of information on the theories of reversing vampyrism, but no actual known method... But, that was a site from five years ago. There had to be more information now\...</p>
    <p>After clicking on the other professional looking sites, which basically said the same or similar things, I finally found something more promising. It said that although nobody has been known to stop the transformation, if it were to be stopped at all, it would have to be immediately.. Where some sort of anti-vampyre drug would be injected directly into the body, forcing the vampyre DNA to dissipate... If it could work at all. But as far as the author of the article knew, nobody had tried such a thing.</p>
    <p>So, how soon is immediately..?</p>
    <p>I continued reading down the page, hoping to find some other valuable information. Where could I get an injectable anti-vampyre drug??</p>
    <p>Of course, like rabies, once signs of vampyrism begin to emerge, it would be too late. By that point, the once-human's DNA would be mostly vampyre, and...</p>
    <p>My heart sunk when I skimmed that part, and I re-read it a few times, hoping to God it didn't say what I thought it said...</p>
