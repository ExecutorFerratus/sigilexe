  <h2>THE SETUP</h2>


  <div class="timeline-item">
    <div class="timeline-time">Ferratus</div>
    <p>Mason's 1st person POV: We arrived in Vancouver at 4:43 PM. After checking in at the Guild Headquarters and getting our temporary microchips a couple hours later, we filed back into the buses and headed out to the camping grounds.</p>
    <p>I knew I wasn't physically prepared, but mentally, nothing could stop me. I knew exactly what I was meant to be-- and that was a Fighter. As long as I tested into the Fighting Guild, then I could specialize and become what I was really meant to be... I would avenge my little sister and everyone else in the world who had ever had their lives stolen by vampyres. I could help the world get back on the right track. If I really made the right moves, I might even make it into the Secret Sector. Most people said it didn't really exist, but I knew better. Because I wasn't like most people. I wasn't another mind-numbed idiot. I was already ahead of the game...</p>
    <p>Once we made it to the camping grounds and started getting set up in the cabins there, we were directed to the dining hall, where some communal stew (supposedly imbued with "mega nutritions") was passed around. It took forever to get to me, but once I had my bowl, I was able to finally join Stacy, who was already hanging with Daniel and everyone.</p>
    <p>"You made it," Stacy beamed at me, scooting over to make room for me in the small circle.</p>
    <p>"Finally, huh?" I smiled back, heart racing from the excitement of it all. "Are you ready for this?"</p>
    <p>"Oh yeah, I was born ready," she nodded nonchalantly, drinking some stew. She looked pretty at ease, actually.</p>
    <p>"Have you decided what you want to be, yet?"</p>
    <p>"Nah, I figure whatever I get is meant to be," she shrugged with a pleased smile. I grinned back, boosted by her confidence and casual behavior around the whole thing. It made it seem not so scary, somehow. Even though it would determine the entire rest of my life and all...</p>

  <div class="timeline-item">
    <div class="timeline-time">Velius</div>
    <p><strong>Mason’s 1st Person POV</strong></p>
    <p>I could still feel the dull throb in my side, radiating out like a bruise beneath the stitches. Every time I took a deep breath, it tugged—just enough to remind me I’d fallen off a damn cliff and lived to tell the story. But that ache wasn’t the worst part. The worst part was how small it made me feel. For all my big talk, all my anger, all my <em>plans</em>… one wrong step and the mountain almost did me in before I ever got the chance to prove myself.</p>
    <p>But I was still here. That had to count for something.</p>
    <p>The horse’s hooves crunched steadily against the gravel path, Daniel slumped lazily in the saddle, his fractured leg swaying slightly with each step. The rest of us trudged alongside, shadows in the thickening fog. It wrapped around us like fingers—cold, heavy, suffocating.</p>
    <p>My mind wasn’t on the path, though. It was on <em>them.</em></p>
    <p>Vampires. Blood-sucking monsters pretending to be human.</p>
    <p>Daniel’s joke about the microchips being some VR simulation had made me laugh, but the second Shorty brought up the vampires, that old, familiar heat boiled back up inside me like lava bubbling beneath the surface. I couldn’t even help it. It was like a switch flipped in my brain—rage mode: activated.</p>
    <p><strong>"I wish they'd take them all to some work camp where they'd burn to death in the sunlight,"</strong> I snapped without thinking, the words sharp and automatic like muscle memory.</p>
    <p>Daniel just laughed, shaking his head like I was some kind of joke. <strong>"Damn. Instantly angry."</strong></p>
    <p>I rolled my eyes at him, not in the mood to let it slide. <strong>"Well, I know you agree with me."</strong></p>
    <p><strong>"True enough,"</strong> he admitted with a shrug. <strong>"I'm just not passionate about it like you are."</strong></p>
    <p>That made me pause for a second. <em>Passionate</em>? Was that what this was?</p>
    <p>No. Passion was what people felt about art or sports or whatever. This wasn’t passion. This was purpose.</p>

  <h2>THE MOMENT</h2>


  <blockquote>
    <div class="timeline-time">Ferratus</div>
    <p>Mason's 1st person POV:</p>
    <p>We continued with the conversation for a bit until we suddenly came to what appeared to be a fork in the road. For some reason, it really confused Daniel's horse and she didn't want to take either path. She keep tilting her head back stubbornly.</p>
    <p>The rest of the group didn't notice and kept walking for a few paces, naturally taking the path on the right because it was more open...</p>
    <p>"Alright, sure, leave us behind," I called out. They stopped and looked back at us.</p>
    <p>"Oh sorry," the blonde girl said, and they laughed a little. Finally, the horse started moving again, though she was going abnormally slow. Was something wrong..? Or maybe she was just tired...</p>
    <p>It only took a few minutes before the fog had once again grown so thick I couldn't see the group ahead of us anymore.</p>
    <p>"This is eerie as hell," I said, my hand on the horse's mane as we walked.</p>
    <p>"No kidding," Daniel muttered.</p>
    <p>Just then, completely out of the blue, some commotion in the bushes behind us gave me a heart attack and sent the horse running ahead. I tried running to catch up, but my side stopped me from going too fast.</p>
    <p>"Wait!" I exclaimed. "Wait for me!"</p>
    <p>I glanced behind me but there was nothing there, so I tried to slow my heart rate and just pick up my pace. Everything was okay.</p>
    <p>I would catch up any minute now, even if I couldn't hear them... They couldn't be too far ahead. And as for the noise in the bushes? Usually loud noises were just birds or squirrels...</p>
    <p>My heart was still racing and I had a sick turning feeling in my stomach. I wanted to run fast and far, but I knew my stitches would split for sure if I did that.</p>
    <p>Just then, there was a feeling of my shoulder being touched. I whirled around, adrenaline surging through my system as I turned to face the intruder.</p>
    <p>Instantly I knew the face. It was Levi.</p>
    <p>He gave me a cold smile, and I watched in horror as the other vampires I knew came out from the fog. Please, be a simulation...</p>
    <p>"L-Levi??" I stammered, feeling a chill run down my spine. "What are you doing?"</p>
    <p>"Well, we were curious.. You know, with all your tough talk about killing us and all.. How much of a Fighter you really are," he said arrogantly.</p>
    <p>"How did you know where to find me?" was all I could think to ask.</p>
    <p>"We found a map of the testing grounds," he smirked. "Also, we could smell your blood from like a mile..."</p>
    <p>I scowled. It was disgusting. "So.. what are you going to do? My friends are right up ahead, you know... Also, three against one while I'm injured isn't fair. I thought you guys at least had a little honor," I tried to act braver than I felt.</p>
    <p>"Maybe we'll just beat you down, one at a time. That would be fair, right?" he smiled again.</p>
    <p>Clarissa, the red-haired female vamp in the class stepped forward then. "Or we could just kill him. People die here all the time here, after all... He'd just be one more statistic," she said to Levi.</p>
