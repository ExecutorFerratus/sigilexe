  <h2>THE SETUP</h2>


  <div class="timeline-item">
    <div class="timeline-time">Velius</div>
    <p><strong>[Cassian Hale (Hazel Hanson) POV]</strong></p>
    <p>The scream tore out of me before I could stop it—a raw, feral <em>howl</em> that ripped through the trees, echoing off the walls of the camp like something wounded and dying.</p>
    <p>It <em>was</em> something dying.</p>
    <p><em>Me.</em></p>
    <p>Hazel Hanson was gone.</p>
    <p>And in her place, again, stood Cassian Hale—a stranger wrapped around my bones, wearing my skin like armor I could never peel off.</p>
    <p>I collapsed onto the ground, my fingers clawing at the dirt, desperate to <em>hold onto</em> something, anything that felt real, as if digging deep enough could bury the truth.</p>
    <p>But the truth was carved into me.</p>
    <p>I could feel it everywhere.</p>
    <p>The broadness of my shoulders, the roughness of my hands, the flatness of my chest pressing against the ground. My voice—<em>God, my voice</em>—still raw from screaming, now carrying that deep, guttural edge that didn’t belong to me.</p>
    <p>I punched the earth until my knuckles bled, gasping, sobbing, shaking.</p>
    <p>"<em>NO! NO! NO!</em>" I roared, my voice breaking into something jagged and hollow.</p>
    <p>Ren was beside me in an instant, her hands on my shoulders, trying to pull me back from the edge.</p>
    <p>"<em>Cassian—</em>”</p>
    <p>"<em>DON’T CALL ME THAT!</em>" I bellowed, twisting out of her grip, my face wet with tears and dirt. "<em>I’m not him—I’m not—I’m—</em>"</p>
    <p>But I couldn’t finish.</p>
    <p>Because even as the words fought their way out, my body betrayed me.</p>
    <p>I <em>was</em> him.</p>
    <p>No matter how much I screamed, no matter how much I denied it.</p>
    <p>The women stood in a wide circle around me, some with pity in their eyes, others with cold indifference. Lira watched silently, her arms crossed, her expression sharp and distant.</p>
    <p>"<em>Look at me!</em>" I shouted at her, my voice shaking with rage. "<em>Is this what you wanted? To see me broken?</em>"</p>
    <p>She didn’t flinch. Didn’t move. Just stared.</p>
    <p>"<em>You think this is strength?</em>" I spat, my voice trembling. "<em>You think this body makes me less? It’s just flesh—</em>it’s not who I am!<em>"</p>
    <p>But it </em>was.*...</p>
  </div>

  <div class="timeline-item">
    <div class="timeline-time">Ferratus</div>
    <p>​"Oh my fucking God. NO!!!! I will destroy this whole fucking world!!!" He screamed.</p>

  <h2>THE MOMENT</h2>


  <blockquote>
    <div class="timeline-time">Velius</div>
    <p><strong>[Cassian Hale (Hazel Hanson) POV]</strong></p>
    <p>"<em>OH MY FUCKING GOD. NO!!!</em>"</p>
    <p>The scream ripped from my chest, raw and unfiltered, louder than anything I'd ever felt before—<em>because I didn't just feel it, I WAS it.</em></p>
    <p>"<em>I WILL DESTROY THIS WHOLE FUCKING WORLD!!!</em>"</p>
    <p>I grabbed a fistful of dirt, hurling it into the air as if it could take my rage with it, but it just scattered like ashes—<em>meaningless,</em> like me.</p>
    <p>The ground trembled beneath me, though whether it was real or just the trembling of my own body, I couldn’t tell. My fists pounded the earth again, harder this time, knuckles splitting open, blood mixing with dirt, grounding me in a body I wanted to crawl out of.</p>
    <p>Ren tried to reach for me again, but I twisted away, staggering to my feet, breath ragged, chest heaving. My vision blurred with tears—<em>or maybe fury, maybe both.</em></p>
    <p>"<em>DO YOU HEAR ME?!</em>" I bellowed into the sky, as if the wizard could hear me through the void. "<em>YOU THINK THIS IS A LESSON?! YOU THINK THIS IS JUSTICE?!</em>"</p>
    <p>The world felt too small for the rage inside me. My body couldn’t contain it, this prison of flesh and bone that wasn’t <em>mine.</em></p>
    <p>I wanted to tear it apart.</p>
    <p><em>Rip it off.</em></p>
    <p>Break it until there was nothing left of me to recognize.</p>
    <p>"<em>I HATE YOU!</em>" I screamed, my voice cracking, echoing off the trees, off the stones, swallowed by a sky that didn’t care. "<em>I HATE ALL OF YOU!</em>"</p>
    <p>The women stood in stunned silence, their faces blurred through the haze of my tears. Some with pity. Some with fear. Lira, of course, with that same unreadable, stone-cold face.</p>
    <p>"<em>You did this!</em>" I spat, pointing at all of them, at no one, at <em>everyone.</em> "<em>You made me believe I was nothing the second I became him. You treated me like I wasn’t even a person!</em>"</p>
    <p>My knees buckled, and I collapsed again, fists pounding the ground until I couldn’t feel my hands anymore—until the pain was loud enough to drown out everything else.</p>
    <p>"<em>I want to die,</em>" I whispered, face pressed into the dirt. "<em>I’d rather die than live like this.</em>"</p>
    <p>The words hung there, fragile and ugly, because they were true.</p>
    <p>I felt Ren’s hand on my back, trembling.</p>
    <p>"<em>Cassian…</em>"</p>
    <p>"<em>DON’T CALL ME THAT!</em>"</p>
    <p>I rolled onto my back, staring up at the sky, wishing it would swallow me whole.</p>
    <p>But it didn’t.</p>
    <p>Because life is cruel like that.</p>
    <p>It lets you break.</p>
    <p>It lets you scream.</p>
    <p>But it doesn’t let you <em>escape.</em></p>
    <p>Not like this.</p>
